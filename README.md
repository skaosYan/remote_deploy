# remote_deploy
Simple remote deployment tool  

#Architecture

# Notes
- For security reasons, it is a good practice not to use root access, some other user should be used and sudo privilege granted. But for the sake of  --- simplicity I use root.  
- For security reasons, it is a good practice not to store password in the code, so program will ask for password.  
- For security reasons, files are allowed to be installed only to ONE remote folder, which is web root, ALLOWED_DIR=/var/www/html/  
- For security reasons, root password is redacted from log, password replaced with the keyword <censored> :)
- For simplicity, creation of remote directories is not supported. Only remote files installation is supported as required.  

# Configuration

Deployment configuration is stored in JSON file configuration.json:
- "hosts" section lists the hosts where to install files
- "packages" section lists the packages to install or to remove
- "files" section lists the file for web server to deploy. Only /var/www/html/ is allowed to deploy to
- "restarts" section lists the services to restart


# How to invoke program
  ```python3 remote.py```
Script will ask for user password.

Check logs:
  ```tail -f remote.log```


# How to invoke tests
  ```python3 tests/tests.py```  
Check logs:  
  ```tail -f tests/remote.log```

Sample tests output:

```
Enter password for user root :
