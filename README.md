# remote_deploy
Simple tool to deploy remote files and packages

# Requirements
- Python3 is required.
- sshpass package is required to pass SSH password non-interactively. Install sshpass on MacOS:  
```brew install sshpass```

# Architecture

All the code is placed in a single Python file remote.py, located on a client. Remote hosts do not need any bootstrap.  

Based on the local configuration.json, Python script remote.py through SSH connects to remote hosts. Script processes configured hosts one by one, installs/remove packages, installs files and restarts services by running remote SSH commands.

Two Python classes handle the workflow:
- RemoteExecutor. This class opens SSH session and executes remote commands over SSH
- Control. This class reads JSON configuration, password and creates RemoteExecutor instances, passing configuration info to them

Script manages deployments in a single thread. For a larger number of hosts class Control can be easily extended into multi-threaded architecture to manage a massive number of hosts in parallel, asynchronously.

# Notes
- For security reasons, it is a good practice not to use root access. Instead, another user should be used, with sudo privileges granted. However, for the sake of simplicity, the root user is still used.
- For security reasons, it is a good practice not to store passwords in the code. Therefore, the program will prompt the user for the password.
- For security reasons, files are only allowed to be installed in one remote folder, which is the web root directory: ALLOWED_DIR=/var/www/html/
- For security reasons, root password is redacted from log, password replaced with the keyword <censored> :)
- For the sake of simplicity, the creation of remote directories is not supported; only the installation of remote files is supported as required.


# Configuration

Deployment configuration is stored in JSON file configuration.json:
- "hosts" section lists the hosts where to install files
- "packages" section lists the packages to install or remove. JSON "deploy_mode" element controls mode: it can take a value "install" or "remove".
- "files" section lists the files to deploy with their attributes . Only remote web root /var/www/html/ is allowed for file installation. Files for remote installation are taken from local files2deploy folder.
- "restarts" section lists the OS services to restart  


# How to invoke program
  ```python3 remote.py```
Script will ask for a password.  

Check logs:
```tail -f remote.log```

# Unit tests
Validate that a host responds through HTTP with response "Hello, world!\n"  

How to invoke tests:
  ```python3 tests/tests.py```

Check logs:
  ```tail -f tests/remote.log```

Sample tests output:

```
Enter password for user root :
